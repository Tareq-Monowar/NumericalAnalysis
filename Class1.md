1. Choosing the Range in the Bisection Method

A better approach to choosing the range [a, b] in the bisection method is to:
- Ensure f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs (f(a)*f(b) < 0), indicating a root exists between them.
- Use prior knowledge, graphing, or sign changes in a table of values to select a tight interval close to the root, which reduces the number of iterations.
- Avoid unnecessarily wide intervals, as they increase iterations.

2. Applying the Technique to Solve a Problem

Let's solve f(x) = x^3 - x - 2 = 0.

i) Traditional Bisection Method

Step 1: Choose a wide interval, e.g., a = 1, b = 2:

f(1) = 1 - 1 - 2 = -2
f(2) = 8 - 2 - 2 = 4
f(1)*f(2) < 0, so a root exists.

Step 2: Apply bisection iterations (tolerance = 0.01):

| Iteration | a    | b    | Midpoint (c) | f(c)   |
|-----------|------|------|--------------|--------|
| 1         | 1    | 2    | 1.5          | -0.125 |
| 2         | 1.5  | 2    | 1.75         | 1.609  |
| 3         | 1.5  | 1.75 | 1.625        | 0.666  |
| 4         | 1.5  | 1.625| 1.5625       | 0.252  |
| 5         | 1.5  |1.5625| 1.53125      | 0.059  |
| 6         | 1.5  |1.53125|1.515625     | -0.034 |
| 7         |1.515625|1.53125|1.5234375  | 0.012  |
| 8         |1.515625|1.5234375|1.51953125| -0.011 |

Root found at x = 1.52 after 8 iterations.

ii) Bisection Implementation (Better Approach)

Step 1: Use a better initial guess by evaluating f(x) at several points:

- f(1.5) = -0.125
- f(1.6) = 0.296
- So, choose a = 1.5, b = 1.6.

Step 2: Apply bisection iterations (tolerance = 0.01):

| Iteration | a    | b    | Midpoint (c) | f(c)   |
|-----------|------|------|--------------|--------|
| 1         |1.5   |1.6   |1.55          |0.089   |
| 2         |1.5   |1.55  |1.525         |-0.007  |
| 3         |1.525 |1.55  |1.5375        |0.041   |
| 4         |1.525 |1.5375|1.53125       |0.017   |
| 5         |1.525 |1.53125|1.528125     |0.005   |

Root found at x \approx 1.53 after 5 iterations.

 Comparison
- Traditional method: 8 iterations
- Better approach: 5 iterations

**Conclusion:** Choosing a tighter initial interval around the root reduces the number of iterations required for convergence in the bisection method.
